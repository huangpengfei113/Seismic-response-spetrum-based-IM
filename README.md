# Seismic-response-spetrum-based-IM
Propose seismic intensity measure (IM) based on seismic response spectrum using ANN
This project present a novel approach to constructing intensity measures (IMs) for underground structures using seismic response spectrums. The proposed IM takes the form of an integral of the product of the response spectrum and an arbitrary function that reflects the relative importance of each range of period to the seismic response of underground structures. To obtain the arbitrary function, an artificial neural network (ANN) technique is employed.
